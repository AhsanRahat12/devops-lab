# DevOps Lab

My learning journal documenting real-world problems solved, experiments, and technical notes as I build DevOps skills. This is where I document the journey from data analytics to DevOps engineering.

## What's Here

This repository contains raw troubleshooting notes, configuration guides, and technical documentation from my daily learning. It's not polished tutorials - it's real problems I've encountered and how I solved them.

## Repository Structure

### 📦 [docker/](./docker/)
Docker containerization, troubleshooting, and configuration notes.

### 🐧 [linux/](./linux/)
Linux system administration, security, and display server configuration.

### ☸️ [kubernetes/](./kubernetes/)
Kubernetes orchestration, cluster management, and deployment configurations.

## Why This Exists

As I transition from data analytics to DevOps, I'm documenting everything I learn and every problem I solve. This serves as:
- My personal reference documentation
- Proof of hands-on learning
- Evidence of problem-solving methodology
- A resource for others facing similar issues

## Technologies Covered

- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Desktop
- **Operating Systems:** Arch Linux, Raspberry Pi OS
- **Security:** GPG, SSH, YubiKey, credential management
- **Display Servers:** Wayland, X11, XWayland
- **Tools:** systemd, pass, git

## Learning Approach

Each note typically includes:
- The problem I encountered
- The solution that worked
- Why it worked (technical explanation)
- Commands and configuration for future reference

**Note:** These are working notes, not polished articles. They're written primarily for my own reference, but shared publicly in case they help others troubleshooting similar issues.
